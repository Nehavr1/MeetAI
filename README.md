# MeetAI
This app is used by people who have already created user profiles for groups on meeting apps( like groups for hiking, travelling, excercise etc) 
and new members can join the group using **API queries** to join the relevant group. Once the new members join the group 
the groups increase in the number of followers (or in this case stars). It works on 3 levels. **Base level** is below 
a certain number of followers (in this case below 3 stars), **Midlevel** is above a certain number of followers but below 
a certain higher number of follower( in this case above 3 stars and below 6 stars) and **StartUp** level is over a certain 
number of followers (Over 6 starts). This helps people put effort to build groups and interact better in real time.
